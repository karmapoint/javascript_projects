# POW: JavaScript Drum Machine #

https://karmapoint.github.io/javascript_projects/drum_machine/

A simple keyboard driven JavaScript audio sample player which I started by doing some [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) tutorials.

I designed the logo and page as well as did the coding, extending the original tutorial code from Wes.

## Future Improvements ##
 * Improve responsiveness for mobile devices
    * Make large screen version with two 8 button rows
    * Make small screen version with smaller logo and now alpha-labels for the buttons
 * Add click/touch to play for the buttons
 * Add a pre-loader so there is no delay on samples on first run
