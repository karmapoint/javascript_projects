# POW: JavaScript Drum Machine #

https://karmapoint.github.io/javascript_projects/drum_machine/

A simple keyboard driven JavaScript audio sample player which I started by doing some [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) tutorials.

I designed the logo and page as well as did the coding, extending the original tutorial code from Wes.

The design is now responsive, optimized for mobile phones, tablets, and large screen monitors. Samples will play whether you use a keyboard, click with a mouse, or tap with your finger on a touchscreen device.

## Future Improvements ##
 * ~~Improve responsiveness for mobile devices~~
    * ~~Make large screen version with two 8 button rows~~
    * ~~Make small screen version with smaller logo and now alpha-labels for the buttons~~
 * ~~Add click/touch to play for the buttons~~
 * ~~Add a pre-loader so there is no delay on samples on first run~~
